# jobjdiff
java object differencer.

prints a list of 'differences' between two java objects.

## Purpose
intended to be a unit testing tool.

## How
diffs are generated by:
* converting each object into a tree
* traverse both trees
* add a diff to a string list each time there's delta

## Todo: test cases to add
* lists
* maps
* lists,maps that do _not_ implement the java interfaces
* optional
